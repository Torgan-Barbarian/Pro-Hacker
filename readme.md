Course Expectations: This is a hybrid learning course, wherein students attend an in-person session once each week and use a variety of online resources to master the learning objectives. Several of the sites will require account creation where you will use your Tri-C email address. Every attempt has been made to limit the need for such account creation however, in several cases it is necessary to provide essential industry-level experience in the topics. This course requires independent learning, strong selfdiscipline, and effective time-management skills.  Course Correspondence: All communication in this course is to be made via your Tri-C email account (Tri-C email can be accessed via My Tri-C Space). Make sure to check your email at least once per day to ensure you are receiving all information sent out in the course. Official announcements and communication will be made via email and Blackboard Announcements. During the week I will respond to your emails within 24 hours or less (typically much less). Be sure to be as specific as possible and send screen shots and/or samples of the issue so that I can respond as thoroughly as possible making the best use of your time.
